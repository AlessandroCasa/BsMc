\usage{
AEdist.meas(n = 100, hmin = 0.05, hmax = 1, byh = hmin, mus = 0,
  sigmas = 1, props = 1, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{sample size of the simulated Monte Carlo samples.}

\item{hmin}{lower value for the grid of bandwidths.}

\item{hmax}{upper value for the grid of bandwidths.}

\item{byh}{increment of the grid sequence}

\item{mus}{vector of means of the mixture components.}

\item{sigmas}{vector of standard deviations of the mixture components.}

\item{props}{vector of mixing proportions of the mixture components.}

\item{plot}{if TRUE the curve of the AEDM as a function of bandwidth values in the grid is displayed along with the single DM for each Monte Carlo sample.}
}
\value{
the value of the EDM for each value in the grid.

\description{
Compute the Asymptotic Expected Distance in Measure (AEDM) between a kernel estimator-induced partition and the population one defined by a K-component normal mixture density over a grid of bandwidths.
